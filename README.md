- ⚡ Fun fact:  Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible.
                This is because honey is naturally very acidic and low in moisture, making it one of the few foods that can last indefinitely.
